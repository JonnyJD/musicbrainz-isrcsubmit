<h2>Available Downloads</h2>

<div class="twolineheadings">

<h3>isrcsubmit.py:</h3>
<h4>(core script)</h4>

This is the core script and mainly intended for Linux users.
The additional libraries can be installed with the package manager
of your distribution or manually.

<h3>isrcsubmit-\*-win32:</h3>
<h4>(script + libdiscid + python-musicbrainz2 + mediatools + .bat)</h4>

This is the package for Windows users.
There is a precompiled discid.dll, python-musicbrainz2
and mediatools.exe included.
It also includes a batchfile to start iscrsubmit in a terminal.
Mediatools is the preferred backend on windows since it has a nice algorithm to make sure the ISRCs are attached to the correct tracks.


<h3>isrcsubmit-\*-MacIntel/PPC:</h3>
<h4>(script + libdiscid + python-musicbrainz2 + .sh)</h4>

These are packages for Mac OS X users.
It is more difficult to get libdiscid precompiled for Mac and less
Mac users have Xcode installed to compile it themselves.
Therefore the Mac Packages include a precompiled universal (intel32/64/ppc)
libdiscid.0.dylib.
An isrcsubmit.sh is included to start with the correct python binary.


<h3>isrcsubmit-\*.tar.gz:</h3>
<h4>(official tarball; complete source download as on github)</h4>

This is the official release version.
This is basically the same as downloading the tag in github.
There might be minor packaging differences and the folder name is different.
A setup.py and all script from the other packages are included.
