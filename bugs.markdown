## Submitting Bugs/Issues

### Where?
Bugs/issues should be reported on [Github]({{ site.issues.url }}) if possible.

There is also a
[Google Code Mirror](http://code.google.com/p/musicbrainz-isrcsubmit/)
available and I also accept bugs per mail: github@JonnyJD.net

In the end I will always create an issue at github,
so it would be of help if you could open a github account and/or follow
the issue there.


### How?

Please include the version of isrcsubmit
and the platform/operating system you are using.

You should also include how you installed isrcsubmit.
There are differenct packages available for [download](download)
and you might even have used a package manager.

Please include the complete command line you used
and the (problematic piece of the) output.
Additionally tell me about the disc you were trying when this problem is only
related to certain discs.
